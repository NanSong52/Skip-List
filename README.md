# Skip-List CPP

The project leverages skiplists, which are an alternative to balanced trees and are used extensively in databases and ordered data management. Skiplists allow for average time complexity of logarithmic order O(logN) for search, insertion, and deletion operations.

# Keys
1. Key-Value Storage Engine: The application is a key-value storage system, similar to structures used in databases like Redis and LevelDB. It uses skiplists to maintain order and ensure efficient data retrieval.

2. Performance Optimization: It includes optimizations for high-performance scenarios, handling large volumes of data operations with high throughput for both read and write operations.

3. Concurrency and Multi-threading: Although not detailed in the basic project description, the use of C++ and the nature of key-value stores often imply the need to manage data in a multi-threaded environment, ensuring thread safety and concurrency control.

4. Persistence and Durability: The project handles data persistence, enabling data to be written to and read from disk, which is a critical aspect of any robust storage system.
